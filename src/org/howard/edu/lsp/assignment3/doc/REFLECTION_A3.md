# Assignment 3 Reflection

## Evolution of Design: Assignment 1 → Assignment 2 → Assignment 3

### Assignment 1: Simple Beginning
- **Structure**: Single class (`HelloWorld`) with one method
- **Purpose**: Basic Java program demonstrating console output
- **Complexity**: Minimal - just prints "Hello World!!"

### Assignment 2: Monolithic ETL Pipeline
- **Structure**: Single class (`ETLPipeline`) with multiple methods
- **Approach**: Procedural programming within one class
- **Functionality**: Complete ETL pipeline with file I/O, data transformation, and business logic
- **Methods**: `runPipeline()`, `extract()`, `transform()`, `transformRow()`, `load()`, `printSummary()`
- **Responsibilities Mixed**: 
  - File reading and CSV parsing
  - Business rule implementation (discount, categorization, price ranges)
  - Data validation and error handling
  - File writing and output formatting
  - Console reporting and summaries

### Assignment 3: Object-Oriented Design
- **Structure**: Five specialized classes with clear responsibilities
- **Approach**: Object-oriented programming with separation of concerns
- **Classes Created**:
  - `Product`: Data model encapsulating product attributes
  - `CSVReader`: Handles file input and parsing
  - `DataTransformer`: Contains business logic and transformations
  - `CSVWriter`: Manages file output and formatting
  - `ETLPipeline`: Orchestrates the process and coordinates components

## Object-Oriented Principles Applied

### 1. Objects and Classes
**Real-world modeling**: Created a `Product` class that represents actual product entities with:
- **Attributes**: productId, name, price, category, priceRange
- **Behaviors**: getters, setters, validation, string representation
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with controlled public access

**Functional separation**: Each class represents a distinct responsibility:
- `CSVReader`: Models the concept of "reading CSV data"
- `DataTransformer`: Models "applying business rules"
- `CSVWriter`: Models "writing CSV output"
- `ETLPipeline`: Models "coordinating the entire process"

### 2. Encapsulation
**Before (Assignment 2)**:
```java
// Direct manipulation of string arrays
String[] row = rawData.get(i);
String productId = row[0];
String name = row[1].toUpperCase(); // Direct transformation
```

**After (Assignment 3)**:
```java
// Controlled access through object methods
Product product = new Product(productId, name, price, category);
String uppercaseName = product.getName().toUpperCase();
product.setName(uppercaseName);
```

**Benefits achieved**:
- **Data Protection**: Product attributes cannot be accessed directly
- **Validation**: Setters can include business rule validation
- **Consistency**: All product modifications go through controlled methods
- **Maintainability**: Changes to data structure only affect the Product class

### 3. Single Responsibility Principle
**Assignment 2 violations**:
- `ETLPipeline` class handled file I/O, parsing, transformations, formatting, and reporting
- `transformRow()` method mixed price calculations, categorization, and formatting

**Assignment 3 improvements**:
- **CSVReader**: Only responsible for reading and parsing CSV files
- **DataTransformer**: Only handles business logic and data transformations
- **CSVWriter**: Only manages output formatting and file writing
- **Product**: Only represents product data and basic operations
- **ETLPipeline**: Only coordinates the workflow

### 4. Inheritance and Polymorphism
**Current Implementation**: 
- Did not implement inheritance or polymorphism as they weren't necessary for the current requirements
- All classes are concrete implementations with specific purposes

**Future Opportunities**:
- **Inheritance**: Could create abstract `FileReader` and `FileWriter` base classes for different formats (XML, JSON)
- **Polymorphism**: Could implement `TransformationStrategy` interface for different business rule sets
- **Example future enhancement**:
```java
public interface FileReader<T> {
    List<T> read(String filePath) throws IOException;
}

public class CSVReader implements FileReader<Product> {
    // Current implementation
}

public class XMLReader implements FileReader<Product> {
    // Future XML support
}
```

## Design Comparison: Specific Changes

### Data Handling
**Assignment 2**: Raw string arrays throughout the pipeline
```java
String[] row = {"P001", "laptop", "999.99", "Electronics"};
String name = row[1].toUpperCase();
```

**Assignment 3**: Structured Product objects
```java
Product product = new Product("P001", "laptop", 999.99, "Electronics");
product.setName(product.getName().toUpperCase());
```

### Business Logic Organization
**Assignment 2**: All transformations in one `transformRow()` method
```java
private String[] transformRow(String[] row) {
    // Name transformation
    // Price discount
    // Category recategorization  
    // Price range determination
    // All mixed together
}
```

**Assignment 3**: Organized transformation steps in `DataTransformer`
```java
private Product transformProduct(Product originalProduct) {
    standardizeCategory(transformed);      // Step 1
    applyPriceAdjustments(transformed);   // Step 2  
    applyTaxCalculations(transformed);    // Step 3
    flagLowStock(transformed);            // Step 4
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
**Assignment 2**: Centralized error handling in main method
```java
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Error during ETL process: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

**Assignment 3**: Distributed error handling with specific exceptions
```java
// CSVReader throws specific IOException with context
// DataTransformer validates inputs with IllegalArgumentException  
// ETLPipeline coordinates and provides user-friendly messages
```

## Testing Strategy and Verification

### Functional Equivalence Testing
**Method**: Compared outputs byte-by-byte between Assignment 2 and Assignment 3

**Test Cases**:
1. **Identical Input Processing**:
   - Used same `data/products.csv` file
   - Verified `data/transformed_products.csv` outputs are identical
   - Confirmed same console messages and formatting

2. **Business Rule Verification**:
   - **Electronics Discount**: Verified 10% discount applied correctly
   - **Premium Categorization**: Confirmed Electronics > $500 → Premium Electronics
   - **Price Ranges**: Validated Low/Medium/High/Premium classifications
   - **Name Transformation**: Ensured uppercase conversion works identically

3. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Empty lines in CSV files
   - Malformed data rows
   - Missing file scenarios
   - Invalid price formats

### Unit Testing Approach
**Assignment 2 Testing Challenges**:
- Had to test entire pipeline as one unit
- Difficult to isolate specific business logic
- Hard to mock file operations

**Assignment 3 Testing Advantages**:
- **Product Class**: Test constructors, getters, setters independently
- **DataTransformer**: Test each transformation rule in isolation
- **CSVReader**: Test parsing logic with controlled input strings
- **CSVWriter**: Test output formatting without file I/O
- **ETLPipeline**: Integration testing with mocked components

## Benefits of Object-Oriented Design

### 1. Maintainability
**Scenario**: Need to change discount rate from 10% to 15%
- **Assignment 2**: Find and modify constant, ensure all references updated
- **Assignment 3**: Change only in `DataTransformer.DISCOUNT_RATE`, automatically affects all usage

### 2. Testability  
**Scenario**: Test price range determination logic
- **Assignment 2**: Must run entire pipeline with test files
- **Assignment 3**: Call `DataTransformer.determinePriceRange()` directly with test values

### 3. Extensibility
**Scenario**: Add support for XML input files
- **Assignment 2**: Major refactoring of existing class required
- **Assignment 3**: Create new `XMLReader` class, minimal changes to `ETLPipeline`

### 4. Reusability
**Scenario**: Use CSV reading functionality in another project
- **Assignment 2**: Copy entire class, remove unneeded methods
- **Assignment 3**: Import `CSVReader` class directly, fully independent

## Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Maintaining Exact Functionality
**Problem**: Ensuring Assignment 3 produces identical results to Assignment 2
**Solution**: 
- Carefully replicated each transformation step
- Used same constants and algorithms
- Extensive testing with multiple input files
**Learning**: Object-oriented refactoring requires meticulous attention to behavioral equivalence

### Challenge 2: Data Flow Design
**Problem**: Deciding how data should flow between classes
**Solution**:
- Used Product objects as data transfer objects
- Made transformations return new objects rather than modifying originals
- Clear input/output contracts for each method
**Learning**: Immutable data patterns reduce bugs and improve testability

### Challenge 3: Error Handling Distribution
**Problem**: Balancing local error handling vs. centralized coordination
**Solution**:
- Individual classes handle their specific error types
- ETLPipeline catches and coordinates user-facing error messages
- Specific exception types provide better debugging information
**Learning**: Layered error handling improves both robustness and user experience
